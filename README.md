# Clicked on Ad Rate Analysis<br>
Overview<br>
This README file provides an overview of the analysis conducted on clicked on ad rates, aiming to understand the factors influencing click-through rates. The analysis explores variables such as time spent on ads, ad content, demographics of users, and their impact on click-through rates. The insights gained can help businesses optimize their ad strategies to maximize conversions while minimizing costs.<br>

Problem Statement<br>
Effective marketing strategies are essential for businesses to generate revenue and gain market share. However, marketing can be a significant expense, necessitating careful allocation of resources. A data-driven approach can help businesses allocate marketing budgets effectively, identify high-performing ads, and optimize ad strategies to enhance revenue and reduce expenses.<br>

Importance of a Data-Driven Approach<br>
Utilizing historical data and conducting A/B testing enables businesses to allocate budgets accurately and identify variables contributing to higher click-through rates. Understanding these variables can lead to optimized ad strategies, resulting in increased revenue and reduced expenses.<br>

Hypothesis Setting<br>
Null Hypothesis (H0): Time spent on the website does not lead to better clicked on ad rates.<br>
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Time spent on the website leads to better clicked on ad rates.<br>
The Ideal Experiment<br>
An ideal experiment involves A/B testing on website visitors, with one group acting as a control and the other as a treatment variable. Different variables such as buzzwords, ad content, and time spent on the website are analyzed to determine their impact on clicked on ad rates.<br>

Data<br>
The analysis utilizes a master dataset combining two Kaggle datasets. The dataset includes information such as time spent on the website, ad topic lines, timestamps, click status, demographics, and geographical data of users.<br>

Data Cleaning and Manipulation<br>
Actions taken include combining datasets, creating dummy variables for categorical variables, dividing continuous variables into buckets, and adding additional columns for ad length. These steps aim to prepare the data for analysis and model building.<br>

Visualizations<br>
Visualizations include heat maps, demographic analyses, time-of-day analyses, and regression model outputs. These visualizations provide insights into clicked on ad rates across different variables and help in understanding their relationships.<br>

Limitations<br>
Limitations of the analysis include the inability of linear models to capture non-linearity, poor fit of discrete response variables in linear models, and the presence of numerous external factors influencing click-through rates.<br>

Conclusion and Takeaway<br>
The analysis rejects the null hypothesis, indicating that time spent on the website does influence clicked on ad rates. However, other factors such as ad topic lines may have a stronger correlation with clicked on ad rates. Further research and data gathering are necessary to improve model performance and understand the complex dynamics affecting click-through rates.<br>
